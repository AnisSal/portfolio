        <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This <strong>Sales Performance Dashboard</strong> was developed using <strong>Power BI</strong> to provide a 
            comprehensive view of business performance across sales, profitability, customer behaviour, and product trends. 
            The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders quickly identify key performance metrics, uncover insights, and 
            support data-driven decision-making.
        </p>

        <!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The dashboard consolidates transactional sales data and presents it in an intuitive and interactive format. 
            Users can filter by <strong>quarter</strong> or <strong>year</strong> to analyse sales trends, customer 
            performance, and product profitability over time. The visuals are organized to show high-level KPIs while also 
            allowing deeper exploration through detailed charts and geographic insights.
        </p>

        <!-- KEY INSIGHTS -->

        <h3>• Sales Distribution by County</h3>
        <p>
            A donut chart visualises sales contributions from various counties, helping identify strong markets and 
            geographic opportunities. Los Angeles County and Orange County contribute the largest portion of total sales.
        </p>

        <h3>• Profit Trend Over Time</h3>
        <p>
            A line chart displays <strong>total profit by date</strong>, showing seasonal patterns and fluctuations from 
            2018 to 2020. Users can observe periods of higher profitability and identify long-term trends or anomalies.
        </p>

        <h3>• Customer Performance Ranking</h3>
        <p>
            A horizontal bar chart ranks customers based on total sales. This highlights top revenue-generating customers 
            and supports strategic relationship management and targeted sales initiatives.
        </p>

        <h3>• Product-Level Sales Insights</h3>

            A product ranking chart reveals which products are performing best, helping stakeholders make decisions on 
            inventory planning, product focus, and marketing strategies.
        </p>

        <h3>• Geographic Profit Mapping</h3>
        <p>
            A map visual plots profit data by latitude and longitude, allowing businesses to assess geographic 
            profit distribution and identify high-value regions. This supports territory planning and resource allocation.
